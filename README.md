  Hi!
  I'm <b>Talha</b>.
  I'm a Control engineer by training, and I enjoy studying mathematical intricacies and expressing them through the medium of programming.
  I currently work on applying Deep Learning to segment 3D MRI scans with (inherent) class-imbalance.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  My work is primarily contained in private repositories (due to contractual obligations) but I'm always available at my <a href="mailto:bukhari.stalha@gmail.com?subject=[GITHELP]">email</a> to address queries.
